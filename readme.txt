# CDAP-Data-Conversion

Independent Project for Duckworth Lab (UPenn)


This application was written for use by the research coordinators in Angela Duckworth's Lab at UPenn in conjunction with their work on the Character Development in Adolescence Project (CDAP). The program reads in raw data from the CDAP study, aggregates the data, and outputs a CSV file with the information in the desired format.
